## Young-Visions

This work represents some aspects of my childhood, tells some places I frequented when I was very young, concrete elements blend with synthetic ones trying to imitate.

They are not memories are simple visions.

Visions for most of the countryside, the mountains, the sounds of footsteps in the water, wheezing for walks, bells and animals. A simple soundscape with transformations towards synthetic soundscapes symbol of my visions and fantasies.
