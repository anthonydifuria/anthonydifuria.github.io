##La Chambre Blanche QUEBEC 2014

###Au-delà de l'atome humain

From August 19 to September 21 2014, LA CHAMBRE BLANCHE welcomes the Italian artist Anthony Di Furia for a 
site-specific residency. This event is a part of an exchange program with the center Rad’Art located in Italy.

For this work entitled ‘’Beyond the human atom’’ the audio artist explores the hardship of communication but 
also the possibility of creating a common ‘’ language’’ between people with the help of new technologies. He 
addresses the many faces of society such as: science, religion and psychology through an in-depth analysis of 
these existing systems.

Thus the participants will be asked to utter sounds as well as, transform and move the sound environment in 
order to create a new, original language, for each and everyone. With this commingling of sounds, Di Furia 
recreates in a way the international atmosphere of the ‘’Spanish Inn’’ around a traditional campfire. The artist 
will use in particular the brainwaves EEG and Leap Motion technologies.
