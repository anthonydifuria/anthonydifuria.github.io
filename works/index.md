I usually try to establish a multi-system relationship.
I try to link systems that apparently speak a language very different through a multidimensional vision, so we realize that they have much in common.
I search the conceptual similarities between science, society, religion, psychology etc. and the "SOUND" through a deep analysis of the systems for a subsequent development and implementation of the final work .
I tend to look deeply all that surrounds me , creating a sincere empathy with the environment. 

The love for the sound improves human and natural communications, it sensitizes my soul and helping me to understand the world.
