---

[Esoteric Synth App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/esoteric-synth/id1454932009) 

Esoteric Synth is a unusual generator of synthetic sound events.
The synthesis is based on 5 oscillators which are intersected through an multiple amplitude modulation and multiple frequency modulation making an high sound variability

The sound events can be controlled in two ways:

EventMode (High Duration and Low Density)

GrainMode (Low Duration and High Density)

This App is suitable to generate complex sound textures, glitches,noises, sound clouds, sound drones, point sounds and more.
