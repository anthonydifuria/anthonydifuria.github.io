[Esoteric Synth App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/esoteric-synth/id1454932009) 

Esoteric Synth is a unusual generator of synthetic sound events.
The synthesis is based on 5 oscillators which are intersected through an multiple amplitude modulation and multiple frequency modulation making an high sound variability

The sound events can be controlled in two ways:

EventMode (High Duration and Low Density)

GrainMode (Low Duration and High Density)

This App is suitable to generate complex sound textures, glitches,noises, sound clouds, sound drones, point sounds and more.

## Dystopia

[Dystopia App Store](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/dystopia/id1524937873)

Dystopia is an experimental distortion for sound transfiguration, it is composed of 7 AUv3 plugins:

1 - DyStort is composed of an input low pass filter, distortion type selector, Dist which acts as a quantity of distortion and a
output lowpass filter.

2 -DySine consists of a sine wave oscillator as driver, controlled by a LowPass filter of the input signal to be transfigured, Gain IN which acts as driver activator, Frequency controls the oscillator frequency, Gain OUT controls the level of distortion and a lowpass filter at the output resulting signal.

3 -DyFM is composed of a driver formed by a frequency modulated sinosuidal oscillator controlled by a lowpass filter applied to the input signal to be transfigured, GainIN acting as driver activator, FreqDev / FreqMod / Frequency are the parameters of the frequency modulation, GainOUT which controls the level of distortion and a lowpass filter at the output of the resulting signal.

4 -DySelf is a distortion that uses the same input signal as driver, it is controlled by an input lowpass filter, driver mix between SELF and INVERSE, GainOut that controls the amount of distortion and a output lowpass filter.

5 - DyGauss has as driver a Gaussian noise generator controlled by a lowpass filter at the input of the signal to be transfigured, a lowpass filter applied to the generator, a potentiometer for selecting the operation of the driver (Gauss / Inverse), a GainOut that controls the amount of distortion and a output lowpass filter.

6 - DyNoise is composed of a driver formed by a sine wave oscillator in which the frequency is randomly controlled between a min and a max value, a GainOut that controls the amount of distortion and a output lowpass filter.

All plugins have input and output controls with relative meter in RMS or dBFS mode and a second stage with a BandPass filter.

7 - DyStopia is an AudioUnit plugin that contains all the other plugins with the addition of a waterfall matrix in which we can divert the signals of the different distortions.

[MoDelayrium App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1559101828)

MoDelayrium is a Audio Units Plugin Suite and it is composed by 4 auv3: ChoriumUnus, DoppleriumUnus, ReverbiumUnus, and TremuloriumUnus.

ChoriumUnus is a chorus/flanger effects with 3 voices and controls of stereo space, low-pass and high-pass filter.
DoppleriumUnus is a strange doppler effect with controls of time, distance, feeedback, airfilter, stereo width, low-pass and high-pass filter.
ReverbiumUnus is a reverb effect in wich we have a pre-delay and post-delay with controls of feedback and depth.
TremuloriumUnus is a tremolo effect with 6 voices and controls of rate, stereo width, rate resize, low-pass and high-pass filter.

MolochVox is a Pitch Shifter and Frequency Shifter consisting of 5 Auv3 plugins:
MolochVox One, MolochVox Two, MolochVox Three, MolochVox Four, MolochVox Five.
In the 5 MolochVox we find Pitch Shift and Frequency Shift controls, harmonic series, inverse harmonic series and geometric series. We can freeze and we can cross fade in Linear Interpolation, Crossing and Morphing modes.
